## ''Wiatr od Morza'' blog site

statically rendered a'la blog site using Next JS, React, Marked and gray-matter

The whole content is stored on serverside and managed based on the frontmatter data in specific md file (i.e getting path to the gallery with photos referring to the specific article).

All images are private.

This is my first project on such scale.
